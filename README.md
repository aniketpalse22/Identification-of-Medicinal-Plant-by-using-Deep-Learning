# Identification of Medicinal Plant by using Deep Learning

This project leverages **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Image Processing** techniques to develop a reliable system for identifying medicinal plants by analyzing leaf images. Using **pre-trained models** like VGG-16, ResNet-50, and YOLOv8, it offers an accessible solution via a web application to address challenges in plant identification, particularly in rural and remote areas. And give the correct information about the plant which is **Ayurvedically Correct**.

## Key Features
- **Custom Dataset:** A curated collection of 17,000 leaf images representing 22 plant species for accurate model training.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Implemented CNN-based models optimized for high precision in plant recognition.
- **Web Application:** A user-friendly platform for easy plant identification and detailed species information from proper Ayurvedic Books.

## Objective
To provide a dependable, efficient, and accessible tool for recognizing medicinal plants, ensuring authenticity and supporting Ayurvedic medicine practices and other peoples (Chemist, Scientists, Students, nature lovers, etc).
